# Day 159 -- Graphs basics

Today's goal: understand **Graphs basics** in plain English, see a tiny code sample for each idea, then practice in `examples/`.

How to study this day:
1. Read each concept's **Plain English** section.
2. Skim the code sample -- predict what it does.
3. Run the matching file under `examples/`.
4. Only then try `questions.md`.

## 1. Adj list vs matrix

### Plain English

Graphs are nodes plus edges. BFS finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs; Dijkstra handles non-negative weights. Union-Find tracks connected components efficiently.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// BFS sketch
std::queue<int> q;
q.push(start);
seen[start] = true;
```

- **Remember:** Pick adjacency lists unless the graph is tiny and dense.
- **Common mistake:** Forgetting to mark nodes visited → infinite loops.

Practice: open `examples/01_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 2. BFS

### Plain English

Graphs are nodes plus edges. BFS finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs; Dijkstra handles non-negative weights. Union-Find tracks connected components efficiently.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// BFS sketch
std::queue<int> q;
q.push(start);
seen[start] = true;
```

- **Remember:** Pick adjacency lists unless the graph is tiny and dense.
- **Common mistake:** Forgetting to mark nodes visited → infinite loops.

Practice: open `examples/02_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 3. DFS

### Plain English

Graphs are nodes plus edges. BFS finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs; Dijkstra handles non-negative weights. Union-Find tracks connected components efficiently.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// BFS sketch
std::queue<int> q;
q.push(start);
seen[start] = true;
```

- **Remember:** Pick adjacency lists unless the graph is tiny and dense.
- **Common mistake:** Forgetting to mark nodes visited → infinite loops.

Practice: open `examples/03_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 4. Connected components

### Plain English

Graphs are nodes plus edges. BFS finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs; Dijkstra handles non-negative weights. Union-Find tracks connected components efficiently.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// BFS sketch
std::queue<int> q;
q.push(start);
seen[start] = true;
```

- **Remember:** Pick adjacency lists unless the graph is tiny and dense.
- **Common mistake:** Forgetting to mark nodes visited → infinite loops.

Practice: open `examples/04_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 5. Topo sort

### Plain English

Graphs are nodes plus edges. BFS finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs; Dijkstra handles non-negative weights. Union-Find tracks connected components efficiently.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// BFS sketch
std::queue<int> q;
q.push(start);
seen[start] = true;
```

- **Remember:** Pick adjacency lists unless the graph is tiny and dense.
- **Common mistake:** Forgetting to mark nodes visited → infinite loops.

## 6. Cycle detection

### Plain English

Graphs are nodes plus edges. BFS finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs; Dijkstra handles non-negative weights. Union-Find tracks connected components efficiently.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// BFS sketch
std::queue<int> q;
q.push(start);
seen[start] = true;
```

- **Remember:** Pick adjacency lists unless the graph is tiny and dense.
- **Common mistake:** Forgetting to mark nodes visited → infinite loops.

## 7. Weighted edges

### Plain English

Graphs are nodes plus edges. BFS finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs; Dijkstra handles non-negative weights. Union-Find tracks connected components efficiently.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// BFS sketch
std::queue<int> q;
q.push(start);
seen[start] = true;
```

- **Remember:** Pick adjacency lists unless the graph is tiny and dense.
- **Common mistake:** Forgetting to mark nodes visited → infinite loops.

Practice: open `examples/07_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 8. Path reconstruction

### Plain English

`std::filesystem` gives portable paths and directory walks. Prefer `path` objects over hand-rolled string concatenation for joining folders.

### Tiny code

```cpp
#include <filesystem>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
for (auto& e : fs::directory_iterator(".")) {
  std::cout << e.path() << '\n';
}
```

- **Remember:** Check `exists` / handle errors — disks fail.
- **Common mistake:** Assuming `/` path separators on every OS without using `path`.

Practice: open `examples/08_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 9. Memory layout

### Plain English

Graphs are nodes plus edges. BFS finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs; Dijkstra handles non-negative weights. Union-Find tracks connected components efficiently.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// BFS sketch
std::queue<int> q;
q.push(start);
seen[start] = true;

- **Common mistake:** Forgetting to mark nodes visited → infinite loops.

Practice: open `examples/09_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 10. Build a graph

### Plain English

### Tiny code

```cpp
// BFS sketch
std::queue<int> q;
q.push(start);

- **Common mistake:** Forgetting to mark nodes visited → infinite loops.

Practice: open `examples/10_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## What you should be able to do after Day 159

- Explain `Graphs basics` to a peer without looking at notes.
- Compile and run all 10 examples with `-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra` (use newer flags only when the day needs C++20+).
- Answer the 5 questions in `questions.md` before peeking at `answers.md`.
- Write one tiny extra program that combines at least 3 of today's concepts.

Or open this day in the **Badsha hub** (`python3 hub/server.py`) and use Learn / Practice / Quiz tabs.
