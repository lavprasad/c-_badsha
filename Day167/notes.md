# Day 167 -- Backtracking

Today's goal: understand **Backtracking** in plain English, see a tiny code sample for each idea, then practice in `examples/`.

How to study this day:
1. Read each concept's **Plain English** section.
2. Skim the code sample -- predict what it does.
3. Run the matching file under `examples/`.
4. Only then try `questions.md`.

## 1. Search tree

### Plain English

DP solves overlapping subproblems once and stores answers. Greedy picks locally best choices when a proof allows it. Backtracking explores choices and undoes them.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<long long> dp(n + 1);
dp[0] = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
  dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + i;  // toy example
```

- **Remember:** Define the state and transition in words before coding.
- **Common mistake:** Memoising without a clear state key → wrong answers.

Practice: open `examples/01_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 2. Pruning

### Plain English

DP solves overlapping subproblems once and stores answers. Greedy picks locally best choices when a proof allows it. Backtracking explores choices and undoes them.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<long long> dp(n + 1);
dp[0] = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
  dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + i;  // toy example
```

- **Remember:** Define the state and transition in words before coding.
- **Common mistake:** Memoising without a clear state key → wrong answers.

Practice: open `examples/02_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 3. Permutations

  dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + i;  // toy example
```

- **Remember:** Define the state and transition in words before coding.
- **Common mistake:** Memoising without a clear state key → wrong answers.

## 4. Combinations

### Plain English

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<long long> dp(n + 1);
dp[0] = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
  dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + i;  // toy example
```

- **Remember:** Define the state and transition in words before coding.
- **Common mistake:** Memoising without a clear state key → wrong answers.

## 5. N-queens idea

### Plain English

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<long long> dp(n + 1);
dp[0] = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
  dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + i;  // toy example
```

- **Remember:** Define the state and transition in words before coding.
- **Common mistake:** Memoising without a clear state key → wrong answers.

## 6. Sudoku idea

### Plain English

DP solves overlapping subproblems once and stores answers. Greedy picks locally best choices when a proof allows it. Backtracking explores choices and undoes them.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<long long> dp(n + 1);
dp[0] = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
  dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + i;  // toy example
```

## 7. State representation

### Plain English

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<long long> dp(n + 1);
dp[0] = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
  dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + i;  // toy example
```

- **Remember:** Define the state and transition in words before coding.

## 8. Iterative deepening idea

### Plain English

DP solves overlapping subproblems once and stores answers. Greedy picks locally best choices when a proof allows it. Backtracking explores choices and undoes them.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<long long> dp(n + 1);
dp[0] = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
  dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + i;  // toy example
```

- **Remember:** Define the state and transition in words before coding.
- **Common mistake:** Memoising without a clear state key → wrong answers.

Practice: open `examples/08_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 9. Complexity explosion

### Plain English

Big-O describes how cost grows with input size. Prefer a clearer O(n log n) algorithm over a clever O(n²) one once n gets large. Measure when constants matter.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// Sorting n items: typically O(n log n)
std::sort(v.begin(), v.end());
```

- **Remember:** Asymptotics first; micro-optimisations later with a profiler.
- **Common mistake:** Optimising a cold path while leaving an O(n²) hot loop alone.

Practice: open `examples/09_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 10. Subset sum backtrack

### Plain English

`map` keeps keys sorted (tree); `unordered_map` hashes for average O(1) lookup. Pick sorted when you need order; pick hash when you need speed and have a good hash.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::unordered_map<std::string, int> freq;
++freq["hi"];
for (auto& [k, v] : freq) std::cout << k << ':' << v << '\n';
```

- **Remember:** `operator[]` default-inserts a value if the key is missing.
- **Common mistake:** Using `[]` when you only meant to look up — prefer `find` / `at` if missing should be an error.

Practice: open `examples/10_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## What you should be able to do after Day 167

- Explain `Backtracking` to a peer without looking at notes.
- Compile and run all 10 examples with `-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra` (use newer flags only when the day needs C++20+).
- Answer the 5 questions in `questions.md` before peeking at `answers.md`.
- Write one tiny extra program that combines at least 3 of today's concepts.

Or open this day in the **Badsha hub** (`python3 hub/server.py`) and use Learn / Practice / Quiz tabs.
