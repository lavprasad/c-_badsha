# Day 21 -- Error handling without exceptions

Today's goal: understand **Error handling without exceptions** in plain English, see a tiny code sample for each idea, then practice in `examples/`.

How to study this day:
1. Read each concept's **Plain English** section.
2. Skim the code sample -- predict what it does.
3. Run the matching file under `examples/`.
4. Only then try `questions.md`.

## 1. Return codes

### Plain English

Exceptions separate the happy path from failure. Throw when a function cannot do its job; catch at a layer that can recover or report. RAII still cleans up during unwind.

### Tiny code

```cpp
try {
  throw std::runtime_error("boom");
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
  std::cerr << e.what() << '\n';
}
```

- **Remember:** Catch by `const` reference, not by value.
- **Common mistake:** Throwing raw pointers or catching by value (slicing).

Practice: open `examples/01_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 2. Out-parameters

### Plain English

Exceptions separate the happy path from failure. Throw when a function cannot do its job; catch at a layer that can recover or report. RAII still cleans up during unwind.

### Tiny code

```cpp
try {
  throw std::runtime_error("boom");
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
  std::cerr << e.what() << '\n';
}
```

- **Remember:** Catch by `const` reference, not by value.
- **Common mistake:** Throwing raw pointers or catching by value (slicing).

Practice: open `examples/02_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 3. Optional-like patterns (pre-optional)

### Plain English

`optional<T>` is either a T or empty — better than magic sentinel values. `variant` holds one of several types. Prefer them over raw unions or `void*` for clarity.

### Tiny code

```cpp
#include <optional>
std::optional<int> parse(bool ok) {
  if (!ok) return std::nullopt;
  return 42;
}
int x = parse(true).value_or(-1);
```

- **Remember:** Check `optional` (or use `value_or`) before calling `value()`.
- **Common mistake:** Calling `opt.value()` on an empty optional → exception.

Practice: open `examples/03_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 4. Error enums

### Plain English

An enum names a small set of choices. Prefer `enum class` so names stay scoped (`Color::Red`) and do not silently become ints.

### Tiny code

```cpp
enum class Color { Red, Green, Blue };
Color c = Color::Red;
// int x = c;  // error — good
int x = static_cast<int>(c);
```

- **Remember:** Use `enum class` unless you truly need old C-style unscoped enums.
- **Common mistake:** Switching on an enum without covering all cases or a `default`.

Practice: open `examples/04_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 5. Assert for invariants

### Plain English

`optional<T>` is either a T or empty — better than magic sentinel values. `variant` holds one of several types. Prefer them over raw unions or `void*` for clarity.

### Tiny code

```cpp
#include <optional>
std::optional<int> parse(bool ok) {
  if (!ok) return std::nullopt;
  return 42;
}
int x = parse(true).value_or(-1);
```

- **Remember:** Check `optional` (or use `value_or`) before calling `value()`.
- **Common mistake:** Calling `opt.value()` on an empty optional → exception.

Practice: open `examples/05_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 6. Logging errors

### Plain English

Exceptions separate the happy path from failure. Throw when a function cannot do its job; catch at a layer that can recover or report. RAII still cleans up during unwind.

### Tiny code

```cpp
try {
  throw std::runtime_error("boom");
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
  std::cerr << e.what() << '\n';
}
```

- **Remember:** Catch by `const` reference, not by value.
- **Common mistake:** Throwing raw pointers or catching by value (slicing).

Practice: open `examples/06_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 7. Fail-fast vs recover

### Plain English

Exceptions separate the happy path from failure. Throw when a function cannot do its job; catch at a layer that can recover or report. RAII still cleans up during unwind.

### Tiny code

```cpp
try {
  throw std::runtime_error("boom");
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
  std::cerr << e.what() << '\n';
}
```

- **Remember:** Catch by `const` reference, not by value.
- **Common mistake:** Throwing raw pointers or catching by value (slicing).

Practice: open `examples/07_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 8. errno style

### Plain English

Exceptions separate the happy path from failure. Throw when a function cannot do its job; catch at a layer that can recover or report. RAII still cleans up during unwind.

### Tiny code

```cpp
try {
  throw std::runtime_error("boom");
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
  std::cerr << e.what() << '\n';
}
```

- **Remember:** Catch by `const` reference, not by value.
- **Common mistake:** Throwing raw pointers or catching by value (slicing).

Practice: open `examples/08_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 9. Combining status + value

### Plain English

Exceptions separate the happy path from failure. Throw when a function cannot do its job; catch at a layer that can recover or report. RAII still cleans up during unwind.

### Tiny code

```cpp
try {
  throw std::runtime_error("boom");
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
  std::cerr << e.what() << '\n';
}
```

- **Remember:** Catch by `const` reference, not by value.
- **Common mistake:** Throwing raw pointers or catching by value (slicing).

Practice: open `examples/09_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 10. Choosing a strategy

### Plain English

Exceptions separate the happy path from failure. Throw when a function cannot do its job; catch at a layer that can recover or report. RAII still cleans up during unwind.

### Tiny code

```cpp
try {
  throw std::runtime_error("boom");
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
  std::cerr << e.what() << '\n';
}
```

- **Remember:** Catch by `const` reference, not by value.
- **Common mistake:** Throwing raw pointers or catching by value (slicing).

Practice: open `examples/10_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## What you should be able to do after Day 21

- Explain `Error handling without exceptions` to a peer without looking at notes.
- Compile and run all 10 examples with `-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra` (use newer flags only when the day needs C++20+).
- Answer the 5 questions in `questions.md` before peeking at `answers.md`.
- Write one tiny extra program that combines at least 3 of today's concepts.

Or open this day in the **Badsha hub** (`python3 hub/server.py`) and use Learn / Practice / Quiz tabs.
