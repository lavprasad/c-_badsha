# Day 158 -- Heaps & priority queues practice

Today's goal: understand **Heaps & priority queues practice** in plain English, see a tiny code sample for each idea, then practice in `examples/`.

How to study this day:
1. Read each concept's **Plain English** section.
2. Skim the code sample -- predict what it does.
3. Run the matching file under `examples/`.
4. Only then try `questions.md`.

## 1. Binary heap property

### Plain English

The heap lives until you release it. Prefer smart pointers and containers over raw `new`/`delete`. If you must use raw ownership, every `new` has exactly one matching `delete` on every path.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// Prefer:
auto p = std::make_unique<int[]>(10);
// instead of new int[10] / delete[]
```

- **Remember:** Match `new` with `delete` and `new[]` with `delete[]`.
- **Common mistake:** Using `delete` on array memory allocated with `new[]`.

Practice: open `examples/01_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 2. heapify

### Plain English

The heap lives until you release it. Prefer smart pointers and containers over raw `new`/`delete`. If you must use raw ownership, every `new` has exactly one matching `delete` on every path.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// Prefer:
auto p = std::make_unique<int[]>(10);
// instead of new int[10] / delete[]
```

- **Remember:** Match `new` with `delete` and `new[]` with `delete[]`.
- **Common mistake:** Using `delete` on array memory allocated with `new[]`.

Practice: open `examples/02_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 3. Top-K

### Plain English

The heap lives until you release it. Prefer smart pointers and containers over raw `new`/`delete`. If you must use raw ownership, every `new` has exactly one matching `delete` on every path.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// Prefer:
auto p = std::make_unique<int[]>(10);
// instead of new int[10] / delete[]
```

- **Remember:** Match `new` with `delete` and `new[]` with `delete[]`.
- **Common mistake:** Using `delete` on array memory allocated with `new[]`.

Practice: open `examples/03_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 4. Merge K lists idea

### Plain English

The heap lives until you release it. Prefer smart pointers and containers over raw `new`/`delete`. If you must use raw ownership, every `new` has exactly one matching `delete` on every path.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// Prefer:
auto p = std::make_unique<int[]>(10);
// instead of new int[10] / delete[]
```

- **Remember:** Match `new` with `delete` and `new[]` with `delete[]`.
- **Common mistake:** Using `delete` on array memory allocated with `new[]`.

Practice: open `examples/04_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 5. Median maintenance idea

### Plain English

Floating-point numbers approximate reals. Equality with `==` is often wrong; compare with a tolerance appropriate to your scale. Watch for NaN and accumulation error.

### Tiny code

```cpp
bool nearly_equal(double a, double b, double eps = 1e-9) {
  return std::fabs(a - b) <= eps;
}
```

- **Remember:** Never loop with `double` counters expecting exact sums.
- **Common mistake:** `if (f == 0.1)` style checks that fail due to representation.

Practice: open `examples/05_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 6. Dijkstra with PQ

### Plain English

Graphs are nodes plus edges. BFS finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs; Dijkstra handles non-negative weights. Union-Find tracks connected components efficiently.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// BFS sketch
std::queue<int> q;
q.push(start);
seen[start] = true;
```

- **Remember:** Pick adjacency lists unless the graph is tiny and dense.
- **Common mistake:** Forgetting to mark nodes visited → infinite loops.

Practice: open `examples/06_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 7. Custom comparators

### Plain English

The heap lives until you release it. Prefer smart pointers and containers over raw `new`/`delete`. If you must use raw ownership, every `new` has exactly one matching `delete` on every path.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// Prefer:
auto p = std::make_unique<int[]>(10);
// instead of new int[10] / delete[]
```

- **Remember:** Match `new` with `delete` and `new[]` with `delete[]`.
- **Common mistake:** Using `delete` on array memory allocated with `new[]`.

Practice: open `examples/07_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 8. Decrease-key pain

### Plain English

The heap lives until you release it. Prefer smart pointers and containers over raw `new`/`delete`. If you must use raw ownership, every `new` has exactly one matching `delete` on every path.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// Prefer:
auto p = std::make_unique<int[]>(10);
// instead of new int[10] / delete[]
```

- **Remember:** Match `new` with `delete` and `new[]` with `delete[]`.
- **Common mistake:** Using `delete` on array memory allocated with `new[]`.

Practice: open `examples/08_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 9. Stability

### Plain English

The heap lives until you release it. Prefer smart pointers and containers over raw `new`/`delete`. If you must use raw ownership, every `new` has exactly one matching `delete` on every path.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// Prefer:
auto p = std::make_unique<int[]>(10);
// instead of new int[10] / delete[]
```

- **Remember:** Match `new` with `delete` and `new[]` with `delete[]`.
- **Common mistake:** Using `delete` on array memory allocated with `new[]`.

Practice: open `examples/09_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 10. Practice set D

### Plain English

`map` keeps keys sorted (tree); `unordered_map` hashes for average O(1) lookup. Pick sorted when you need order; pick hash when you need speed and have a good hash.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::unordered_map<std::string, int> freq;
++freq["hi"];
for (auto& [k, v] : freq) std::cout << k << ':' << v << '\n';
```

- **Remember:** `operator[]` default-inserts a value if the key is missing.
- **Common mistake:** Using `[]` when you only meant to look up — prefer `find` / `at` if missing should be an error.

Practice: open `examples/10_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## What you should be able to do after Day 158

- Explain `Heaps & priority queues practice` to a peer without looking at notes.
- Compile and run all 10 examples with `-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra` (use newer flags only when the day needs C++20+).
- Answer the 5 questions in `questions.md` before peeking at `answers.md`.
- Write one tiny extra program that combines at least 3 of today's concepts.

Or open this day in the **Badsha hub** (`python3 hub/server.py`) and use Learn / Practice / Quiz tabs.
