# Day 90 -- Concurrent data structures lite

Today's goal: understand **Concurrent data structures lite** in plain English, see a tiny code sample for each idea, then practice in `examples/`.

How to study this day:
1. Read each concept's **Plain English** section.
2. Skim the code sample -- predict what it does.
3. Run the matching file under `examples/`.
4. Only then try `questions.md`.

## 1. Thread-safe stack idea

### Plain English

Threads run code concurrently. Shared mutable data needs a mutex (or atomics). Prefer RAII locks (`lock_guard`) so unlock happens even on exceptions.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::mutex m;
int counter = 0;
{
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);
  ++counter;
}
```

- **Remember:** A data race on non-atomic shared data is undefined behaviour.
- **Common mistake:** Locking two mutexes in opposite orders in different threads → deadlock.

Practice: open `examples/01_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 2. Thread-safe queue

### Plain English

Threads run code concurrently. Shared mutable data needs a mutex (or atomics). Prefer RAII locks (`lock_guard`) so unlock happens even on exceptions.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::mutex m;
int counter = 0;
{
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);
  ++counter;
}
```

- **Remember:** A data race on non-atomic shared data is undefined behaviour.
- **Common mistake:** Locking two mutexes in opposite orders in different threads → deadlock.

Practice: open `examples/02_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 3. Lock striping idea

### Plain English

A class bundles data with the operations that keep it valid. Constructors establish invariants; destructors release resources. `struct` defaults to public, `class` to private — that is the main difference.

### Tiny code

```cpp
class Counter {
  int n_ = 0;
public:
  void inc() { ++n_; }
  int get() const { return n_; }
};
```

- **Remember:** Keep data private if invariants matter; expose operations.
- **Common mistake:** Public data fields that let callers break class invariants.

Practice: open `examples/03_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 4. Read-mostly patterns

### Plain English

A class bundles data with the operations that keep it valid. Constructors establish invariants; destructors release resources. `struct` defaults to public, `class` to private — that is the main difference.

### Tiny code

```cpp
class Counter {
  int n_ = 0;
public:
  void inc() { ++n_; }
  int get() const { return n_; }
};
```

- **Remember:** Keep data private if invariants matter; expose operations.
- **Common mistake:** Public data fields that let callers break class invariants.

Practice: open `examples/04_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 5. Copy-on-write maps

### Plain English

`map` keeps keys sorted (tree); `unordered_map` hashes for average O(1) lookup. Pick sorted when you need order; pick hash when you need speed and have a good hash.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::unordered_map<std::string, int> freq;
++freq["hi"];
for (auto& [k, v] : freq) std::cout << k << ':' << v << '\n';
```

- **Remember:** `operator[]` default-inserts a value if the key is missing.
- **Common mistake:** Using `[]` when you only meant to look up — prefer `find` / `at` if missing should be an error.

Practice: open `examples/05_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 6. Hazards

### Plain English

A class bundles data with the operations that keep it valid. Constructors establish invariants; destructors release resources. `struct` defaults to public, `class` to private — that is the main difference.

### Tiny code

```cpp
class Counter {
  int n_ = 0;
public:
  void inc() { ++n_; }
  int get() const { return n_; }
};
```

- **Remember:** Keep data private if invariants matter; expose operations.
- **Common mistake:** Public data fields that let callers break class invariants.

Practice: open `examples/06_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 7. Testing concurrent code

### Plain English

Projects glue skills: clear requirements, small modules, tests, and honest docs. Start with a tiny vertical slice that runs end-to-end, then thicken features.

### Tiny code

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  if (argc < 2) {
    std::cerr << "usage: tool <file>\n";
    return 1;
  }
  // ...
}
```

- **Remember:** Ship a working subset before polishing edge cases.
- **Common mistake:** Building scaffolding for weeks with nothing runnable.

Practice: open `examples/07_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 8. Linearizability intuition

### Plain English

A class bundles data with the operations that keep it valid. Constructors establish invariants; destructors release resources. `struct` defaults to public, `class` to private — that is the main difference.

### Tiny code

```cpp
class Counter {
  int n_ = 0;
public:
  void inc() { ++n_; }
  int get() const { return n_; }
};
```

- **Remember:** Keep data private if invariants matter; expose operations.
- **Common mistake:** Public data fields that let callers break class invariants.

Practice: open `examples/08_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 9. When to use libs

### Plain English

A class bundles data with the operations that keep it valid. Constructors establish invariants; destructors release resources. `struct` defaults to public, `class` to private — that is the main difference.

### Tiny code

```cpp
class Counter {
  int n_ = 0;
public:
  void inc() { ++n_; }
  int get() const { return n_; }
};
```

- **Remember:** Keep data private if invariants matter; expose operations.
- **Common mistake:** Public data fields that let callers break class invariants.

Practice: open `examples/09_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 10. A concurrent bag

### Plain English

A class bundles data with the operations that keep it valid. Constructors establish invariants; destructors release resources. `struct` defaults to public, `class` to private — that is the main difference.

### Tiny code

```cpp
class Counter {
  int n_ = 0;
public:
  void inc() { ++n_; }
  int get() const { return n_; }
};
```

- **Remember:** Keep data private if invariants matter; expose operations.
- **Common mistake:** Public data fields that let callers break class invariants.

Practice: open `examples/10_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## What you should be able to do after Day 90

- Explain `Concurrent data structures lite` to a peer without looking at notes.
- Compile and run all 10 examples with `-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra` (use newer flags only when the day needs C++20+).
- Answer the 5 questions in `questions.md` before peeking at `answers.md`.
- Write one tiny extra program that combines at least 3 of today's concepts.

Or open this day in the **Badsha hub** (`python3 hub/server.py`) and use Learn / Practice / Quiz tabs.
