# Day 176 -- Debugging hard bugs

Today's goal: understand **Debugging hard bugs** in plain English, see a tiny code sample for each idea, then practice in `examples/`.

How to study this day:
1. Read each concept's **Plain English** section.
2. Skim the code sample -- predict what it does.
3. Run the matching file under `examples/`.
4. Only then try `questions.md`.

## 1. Reproduce reliably

### Plain English

Assertions document invariants. `assert` is for runtime checks in debug builds; `static_assert` fails at compile time. Sanitizers catch many memory and UB bugs early.

### Tiny code

```cpp
#include <cassert>
assert(index < size);
static_assert(sizeof(int) >= 4, "need 32-bit int");
```

- **Remember:** Asserts are not for user-facing error handling.
- **Common mistake:** Putting required validation only in `assert` — it disappears in release (`NDEBUG`).

Practice: open `examples/01_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 2. Bisect

### Plain English

Assertions document invariants. `assert` is for runtime checks in debug builds; `static_assert` fails at compile time. Sanitizers catch many memory and UB bugs early.

### Tiny code

```cpp
#include <cassert>
assert(index < size);
static_assert(sizeof(int) >= 4, "need 32-bit int");
```

- **Remember:** Asserts are not for user-facing error handling.
- **Common mistake:** Putting required validation only in `assert` — it disappears in release (`NDEBUG`).

Practice: open `examples/02_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 3. Minimize

### Plain English

Assertions document invariants. `assert` is for runtime checks in debug builds; `static_assert` fails at compile time. Sanitizers catch many memory and UB bugs early.

### Tiny code

```cpp
#include <cassert>
assert(index < size);
static_assert(sizeof(int) >= 4, "need 32-bit int");
```

- **Remember:** Asserts are not for user-facing error handling.
- **Common mistake:** Putting required validation only in `assert` — it disappears in release (`NDEBUG`).

Practice: open `examples/03_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 4. Hypothesize

### Plain English

Assertions document invariants. `assert` is for runtime checks in debug builds; `static_assert` fails at compile time. Sanitizers catch many memory and UB bugs early.

### Tiny code

```cpp
#include <cassert>
assert(index < size);
static_assert(sizeof(int) >= 4, "need 32-bit int");
```

- **Remember:** Asserts are not for user-facing error handling.
- **Common mistake:** Putting required validation only in `assert` — it disappears in release (`NDEBUG`).

Practice: open `examples/04_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 5. Instrument

### Plain English

Assertions document invariants. `assert` is for runtime checks in debug builds; `static_assert` fails at compile time. Sanitizers catch many memory and UB bugs early.

### Tiny code

```cpp
#include <cassert>
assert(index < size);
static_assert(sizeof(int) >= 4, "need 32-bit int");
```

- **Remember:** Asserts are not for user-facing error handling.
- **Common mistake:** Putting required validation only in `assert` — it disappears in release (`NDEBUG`).

Practice: open `examples/05_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 6. Heisenbugs

### Plain English

Assertions document invariants. `assert` is for runtime checks in debug builds; `static_assert` fails at compile time. Sanitizers catch many memory and UB bugs early.

### Tiny code

```cpp
#include <cassert>
assert(index < size);
static_assert(sizeof(int) >= 4, "need 32-bit int");
```

- **Remember:** Asserts are not for user-facing error handling.
- **Common mistake:** Putting required validation only in `assert` — it disappears in release (`NDEBUG`).

Practice: open `examples/06_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 7. Memory corruption

### Plain English

DP solves overlapping subproblems once and stores answers. Greedy picks locally best choices when a proof allows it. Backtracking explores choices and undoes them.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<long long> dp(n + 1);
dp[0] = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
  dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + i;  // toy example
```

- **Remember:** Define the state and transition in words before coding.
- **Common mistake:** Memoising without a clear state key → wrong answers.

Practice: open `examples/07_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 8. Concurrency bugs

### Plain English

Assertions document invariants. `assert` is for runtime checks in debug builds; `static_assert` fails at compile time. Sanitizers catch many memory and UB bugs early.

### Tiny code

```cpp
#include <cassert>
assert(index < size);
static_assert(sizeof(int) >= 4, "need 32-bit int");
```

- **Remember:** Asserts are not for user-facing error handling.
- **Common mistake:** Putting required validation only in `assert` — it disappears in release (`NDEBUG`).

Practice: open `examples/08_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 9. Keep a diary

### Plain English

Assertions document invariants. `assert` is for runtime checks in debug builds; `static_assert` fails at compile time. Sanitizers catch many memory and UB bugs early.

### Tiny code

```cpp
#include <cassert>
assert(index < size);
static_assert(sizeof(int) >= 4, "need 32-bit int");
```

- **Remember:** Asserts are not for user-facing error handling.
- **Common mistake:** Putting required validation only in `assert` — it disappears in release (`NDEBUG`).

Practice: open `examples/09_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 10. Case study walkthrough

### Plain English

Assertions document invariants. `assert` is for runtime checks in debug builds; `static_assert` fails at compile time. Sanitizers catch many memory and UB bugs early.

### Tiny code

```cpp
#include <cassert>
assert(index < size);
static_assert(sizeof(int) >= 4, "need 32-bit int");
```

- **Remember:** Asserts are not for user-facing error handling.
- **Common mistake:** Putting required validation only in `assert` — it disappears in release (`NDEBUG`).

Practice: open `examples/10_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## What you should be able to do after Day 176

- Explain `Debugging hard bugs` to a peer without looking at notes.
- Compile and run all 10 examples with `-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra` (use newer flags only when the day needs C++20+).
- Answer the 5 questions in `questions.md` before peeking at `answers.md`.
- Write one tiny extra program that combines at least 3 of today's concepts.

Or open this day in the **Badsha hub** (`python3 hub/server.py`) and use Learn / Practice / Quiz tabs.
