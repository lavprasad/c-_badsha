# Day 121 -- std::format intro

Today's goal: understand **std::format intro** in plain English, see a tiny code sample for each idea, then practice in `examples/`.

How to study this day:
1. Read each concept's **Plain English** section.
2. Skim the code sample -- predict what it does.
3. Run the matching file under `examples/`.
4. Only then try `questions.md`.

## 1. format basics

### Plain English

Modern C++ (20+) adds safer views (`span`, ranges), clearer comparisons (`<=>`), and better formatting. Use them when your toolchain supports them; otherwise stick to C++17 patterns taught earlier.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// C++20 sketch
// std::span<int> s = arr;
// auto evens = v | std::views::filter([](int x){ return x % 2 == 0; });
```

- **Remember:** Check your compiler's C++20/23 support before relying on these.
- **Common mistake:** Assuming every machine in class/CI has full C++20 library support.

Practice: open `examples/01_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 2. Format strings

### Plain English

Modern C++ (20+) adds safer views (`span`, ranges), clearer comparisons (`<=>`), and better formatting. Use them when your toolchain supports them; otherwise stick to C++17 patterns taught earlier.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// C++20 sketch
// std::span<int> s = arr;
// auto evens = v | std::views::filter([](int x){ return x % 2 == 0; });
```

- **Remember:** Check your compiler's C++20/23 support before relying on these.
- **Common mistake:** Assuming every machine in class/CI has full C++20 library support.

Practice: open `examples/02_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 3. Arguments

// C++20 sketch
// std::span<int> s = arr;
// auto evens = v | std::views::filter([](int x){ return x % 2 == 0; });
```

- **Remember:** Check your compiler's C++20/23 support before relying on these.

## 4. format_to

### Plain English

Modern C++ (20+) adds safer views (`span`, ranges), clearer comparisons (`<=>`), and better formatting. Use them when your toolchain supports them; otherwise stick to C++17 patterns taught earlier.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// C++20 sketch
// std::span<int> s = arr;
// auto evens = v | std::views::filter([](int x){ return x % 2 == 0; });
```

- **Remember:** Check your compiler's C++20/23 support before relying on these.
- **Common mistake:** Assuming every machine in class/CI has full C++20 library support.

Practice: open `examples/04_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 5. Custom formatters idea

### Plain English

Modern C++ (20+) adds safer views (`span`, ranges), clearer comparisons (`<=>`), and better formatting. Use them when your toolchain supports them; otherwise stick to C++17 patterns taught earlier.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// C++20 sketch
// std::span<int> s = arr;
// auto evens = v | std::views::filter([](int x){ return x % 2 == 0; });
```

- **Remember:** Check your compiler's C++20/23 support before relying on these.
- **Common mistake:** Assuming every machine in class/CI has full C++20 library support.

Practice: open `examples/05_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 6. vs iostream/printf

### Plain English

## What you should be able to do after Day 121

- Explain `std::format intro` to a peer without looking at notes.
- Compile and run all 10 examples with `-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra` (use newer flags only when the day needs C++20+).
- Answer the 5 questions in `questions.md` before peeking at `answers.md`.
- Write one tiny extra program that combines at least 3 of today's concepts.

Or open this day in the **Badsha hub** (`python3 hub/server.py`) and use Learn / Practice / Quiz tabs.
