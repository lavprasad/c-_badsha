# Day 103 -- Cache-friendly containers

Today's goal: understand **Cache-friendly containers** in plain English, see a tiny code sample for each idea, then practice in `examples/`.

How to study this day:
1. Read each concept's **Plain English** section.
2. Skim the code sample -- predict what it does.
3. Run the matching file under `examples/`.
4. Only then try `questions.md`.

## 1. vector wins often

### Plain English

Iterators are like advanced pointers into a container. Algorithms take `[begin, end)` half-open ranges. Know when inserts/erases invalidate them.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<int> v{1,2,3};
for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it)
  std::cout << *it << ' ';
```

- **Remember:** After erase, use the iterator that `erase` returns.
- **Common mistake:** Incrementing an invalidated iterator → undefined behaviour.

Practice: open `examples/01_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 2. list rarely

### Plain English

Iterators are like advanced pointers into a container. Algorithms take `[begin, end)` half-open ranges. Know when inserts/erases invalidate them.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<int> v{1,2,3};
for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it)
  std::cout << *it << ' ';
```

- **Remember:** After erase, use the iterator that `erase` returns.
- **Common mistake:** Incrementing an invalidated iterator → undefined behaviour.

Practice: open `examples/02_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 3. Small vector idea

### Plain English

Iterators are like advanced pointers into a container. Algorithms take `[begin, end)` half-open ranges. Know when inserts/erases invalidate them.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<int> v{1,2,3};
for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it)
  std::cout << *it << ' ';
```

- **Remember:** After erase, use the iterator that `erase` returns.
- **Common mistake:** Incrementing an invalidated iterator → undefined behaviour.

Practice: open `examples/03_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 4. Flat maps

### Plain English

Iterators are like advanced pointers into a container. Algorithms take `[begin, end)` half-open ranges. Know when inserts/erases invalidate them.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<int> v{1,2,3};
for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it)
  std::cout << *it << ' ';
```

- **Remember:** After erase, use the iterator that `erase` returns.
- **Common mistake:** Incrementing an invalidated iterator → undefined behaviour.

Practice: open `examples/04_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 5. Sparse sets idea

### Plain English

Iterators are like advanced pointers into a container. Algorithms take `[begin, end)` half-open ranges. Know when inserts/erases invalidate them.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<int> v{1,2,3};
for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it)
  std::cout << *it << ' ';
```

- **Remember:** After erase, use the iterator that `erase` returns.
- **Common mistake:** Incrementing an invalidated iterator → undefined behaviour.

Practice: open `examples/05_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 6. Pool allocators idea

### Plain English

Iterators are like advanced pointers into a container. Algorithms take `[begin, end)` half-open ranges. Know when inserts/erases invalidate them.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<int> v{1,2,3};
for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it)
  std::cout << *it << ' ';
```

- **Remember:** After erase, use the iterator that `erase` returns.
- **Common mistake:** Incrementing an invalidated iterator → undefined behaviour.

Practice: open `examples/06_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 7. Fragmentation

### Plain English

Iterators are like advanced pointers into a container. Algorithms take `[begin, end)` half-open ranges. Know when inserts/erases invalidate them.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<int> v{1,2,3};
for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it)
  std::cout << *it << ' ';
```

- **Remember:** After erase, use the iterator that `erase` returns.
- **Common mistake:** Incrementing an invalidated iterator → undefined behaviour.

Practice: open `examples/07_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 8. Iteration costs

### Plain English

Iterators are like advanced pointers into a container. Algorithms take `[begin, end)` half-open ranges. Know when inserts/erases invalidate them.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<int> v{1,2,3};
for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it)
  std::cout << *it << ' ';
```

- **Remember:** After erase, use the iterator that `erase` returns.
- **Common mistake:** Incrementing an invalidated iterator → undefined behaviour.

Practice: open `examples/08_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 9. Choosing by access pattern

### Plain English

Iterators are like advanced pointers into a container. Algorithms take `[begin, end)` half-open ranges. Know when inserts/erases invalidate them.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<int> v{1,2,3};
for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it)
  std::cout << *it << ' ';

- **Common mistake:** Incrementing an invalidated iterator → undefined behaviour.

Practice: open `examples/09_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 10. Flat map sketch

### Plain English

Iterators are like advanced pointers into a container. Algorithms take `[begin, end)` half-open ranges. Know when inserts/erases invalidate them.

- **Common mistake:** Incrementing an invalidated iterator → undefined behaviour.

Practice: open `examples/10_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## What you should be able to do after Day 103

- Explain `Cache-friendly containers` to a peer without looking at notes.
- Compile and run all 10 examples with `-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra` (use newer flags only when the day needs C++20+).
- Answer the 5 questions in `questions.md` before peeking at `answers.md`.
- Write one tiny extra program that combines at least 3 of today's concepts.

Or open this day in the **Badsha hub** (`python3 hub/server.py`) and use Learn / Practice / Quiz tabs.
