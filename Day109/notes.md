# Day 109 -- Locales & iostream formatting

Today's goal: understand **Locales & iostream formatting** in plain English, see a tiny code sample for each idea, then practice in `examples/`.

How to study this day:
1. Read each concept's **Plain English** section.
2. Skim the code sample -- predict what it does.
3. Run the matching file under `examples/`.
4. Only then try `questions.md`.

## 1. imbue locale

### Plain English

Modern C++ (20+) adds safer views (`span`, ranges), clearer comparisons (`<=>`), and better formatting. Use them when your toolchain supports them; otherwise stick to C++17 patterns taught earlier.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// C++20 sketch
// std::span<int> s = arr;
// auto evens = v | std::views::filter([](int x){ return x % 2 == 0; });
```

- **Remember:** Check your compiler's C++20/23 support before relying on these.
- **Common mistake:** Assuming every machine in class/CI has full C++20 library support.

Practice: open `examples/01_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 2. numpunct idea

### Plain English

Modern C++ (20+) adds safer views (`span`, ranges), clearer comparisons (`<=>`), and better formatting. Use them when your toolchain supports them; otherwise stick to C++17 patterns taught earlier.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// C++20 sketch
// std::span<int> s = arr;
// auto evens = v | std::views::filter([](int x){ return x % 2 == 0; });
```

- **Remember:** Check your compiler's C++20/23 support before relying on these.
- **Common mistake:** Assuming every machine in class/CI has full C++20 library support.

Practice: open `examples/02_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 3. iomanip setw/setprecision

### Plain English

`map` keeps keys sorted (tree); `unordered_map` hashes for average O(1) lookup. Pick sorted when you need order; pick hash when you need speed and have a good hash.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::unordered_map<std::string, int> freq;
++freq["hi"];
for (auto& [k, v] : freq) std::cout << k << ':' << v << '\n';
```

- **Remember:** `operator[]` default-inserts a value if the key is missing.
- **Common mistake:** Using `[]` when you only meant to look up — prefer `find` / `at` if missing should be an error.

Practice: open `examples/03_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 4. boolalpha / hex / fixed

### Plain English

Modern C++ (20+) adds safer views (`span`, ranges), clearer comparisons (`<=>`), and better formatting. Use them when your toolchain supports them; otherwise stick to C++17 patterns taught earlier.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// C++20 sketch
// std::span<int> s = arr;
// auto evens = v | std::views::filter([](int x){ return x % 2 == 0; });
```

- **Remember:** Check your compiler's C++20/23 support before relying on these.
- **Common mistake:** Assuming every machine in class/CI has full C++20 library support.

Practice: open `examples/04_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 5. Custom facets idea

### Plain English

Modern C++ (20+) adds safer views (`span`, ranges), clearer comparisons (`<=>`), and better formatting. Use them when your toolchain supports them; otherwise stick to C++17 patterns taught earlier.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// C++20 sketch
// std::span<int> s = arr;
// auto evens = v | std::views::filter([](int x){ return x % 2 == 0; });
```

- **Remember:** Check your compiler's C++20/23 support before relying on these.
- **Common mistake:** Assuming every machine in class/CI has full C++20 library support.

Practice: open `examples/05_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 6. Thread safety of locales

### Plain English

Threads run code concurrently. Shared mutable data needs a mutex (or atomics). Prefer RAII locks (`lock_guard`) so unlock happens even on exceptions.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::mutex m;
int counter = 0;
{
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);
  ++counter;
}
```

- **Remember:** A data race on non-atomic shared data is undefined behaviour.
- **Common mistake:** Locking two mutexes in opposite orders in different threads → deadlock.

Practice: open `examples/06_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 7. Performance

### Plain English

Modern C++ (20+) adds safer views (`span`, ranges), clearer comparisons (`<=>`), and better formatting. Use them when your toolchain supports them; otherwise stick to C++17 patterns taught earlier.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// C++20 sketch
// std::span<int> s = arr;
// auto evens = v | std::views::filter([](int x){ return x % 2 == 0; });
```

- **Remember:** Check your compiler's C++20/23 support before relying on these.
- **Common mistake:** Assuming every machine in class/CI has full C++20 library support.

Practice: open `examples/07_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 8. When to avoid locales

### Plain English

Modern C++ (20+) adds safer views (`span`, ranges), clearer comparisons (`<=>`), and better formatting. Use them when your toolchain supports them; otherwise stick to C++17 patterns taught earlier.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// C++20 sketch
// std::span<int> s = arr;
// auto evens = v | std::views::filter([](int x){ return x % 2 == 0; });
```

- **Remember:** Check your compiler's C++20/23 support before relying on these.
- **Common mistake:** Assuming every machine in class/CI has full C++20 library support.

Practice: open `examples/08_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 9. Formatting tables

### Plain English

Modern C++ (20+) adds safer views (`span`, ranges), clearer comparisons (`<=>`), and better formatting. Use them when your toolchain supports them; otherwise stick to C++17 patterns taught earlier.

### Tiny code

```cpp
// C++20 sketch
// std::span<int> s = arr;
// auto evens = v | std::views::filter([](int x){ return x % 2 == 0; });
```

- **Remember:** Check your compiler's C++20/23 support before relying on these.
- **Common mistake:** Assuming every machine in class/CI has full C++20 library support.

Practice: open `examples/09_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 10. Pretty print numbers

### Tiny code

```cpp

// std::span<int> s = arr;
// auto evens = v | std::views::filter([](int x){ return x % 2 == 0; });
```

- **Remember:** Check your compiler's C++20/23 support before relying on these.
- **Common mistake:** Assuming every machine in class/CI has full C++20 library support.

Practice: open `examples/10_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## What you should be able to do after Day 109

- Explain `Locales & iostream formatting` to a peer without looking at notes.
- Compile and run all 10 examples with `-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra` (use newer flags only when the day needs C++20+).
- Answer the 5 questions in `questions.md` before peeking at `answers.md`.
- Write one tiny extra program that combines at least 3 of today's concepts.

Or open this day in the **Badsha hub** (`python3 hub/server.py`) and use Learn / Practice / Quiz tabs.
