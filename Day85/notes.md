# Day 85 -- atomics basics

Today's goal: understand **atomics basics** in plain English, see a tiny code sample for each idea, then practice in `examples/`.

How to study this day:
1. Read each concept's **Plain English** section.
2. Skim the code sample -- predict what it does.
3. Run the matching file under `examples/`.
4. Only then try `questions.md`.

## 1. std::atomic

### Plain English

Threads run code concurrently. Shared mutable data needs a mutex (or atomics). Prefer RAII locks (`lock_guard`) so unlock happens even on exceptions.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::mutex m;
int counter = 0;
{
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);
  ++counter;
}
```

- **Remember:** A data race on non-atomic shared data is undefined behaviour.
- **Common mistake:** Locking two mutexes in opposite orders in different threads → deadlock.

Practice: open `examples/01_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 2. load/store

### Plain English

Threads run code concurrently. Shared mutable data needs a mutex (or atomics). Prefer RAII locks (`lock_guard`) so unlock happens even on exceptions.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::mutex m;
int counter = 0;
{
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);
  ++counter;
}
```

- **Remember:** A data race on non-atomic shared data is undefined behaviour.
- **Common mistake:** Locking two mutexes in opposite orders in different threads → deadlock.

Practice: open `examples/02_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 3. fetch_add

### Plain English

Threads run code concurrently. Shared mutable data needs a mutex (or atomics). Prefer RAII locks (`lock_guard`) so unlock happens even on exceptions.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::mutex m;
int counter = 0;
{
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);
  ++counter;
}
```

- **Remember:** A data race on non-atomic shared data is undefined behaviour.
- **Common mistake:** Locking two mutexes in opposite orders in different threads → deadlock.

Practice: open `examples/03_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 4. compare_exchange

### Plain English

Threads run code concurrently. Shared mutable data needs a mutex (or atomics). Prefer RAII locks (`lock_guard`) so unlock happens even on exceptions.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::mutex m;
int counter = 0;
{
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);
  ++counter;
}
```

- **Remember:** A data race on non-atomic shared data is undefined behaviour.
- **Common mistake:** Locking two mutexes in opposite orders in different threads → deadlock.

Practice: open `examples/04_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 5. memory_order relaxed intuition

### Plain English

Threads run code concurrently. Shared mutable data needs a mutex (or atomics). Prefer RAII locks (`lock_guard`) so unlock happens even on exceptions.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::mutex m;
int counter = 0;
{
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);
  ++counter;
}
```

- **Remember:** A data race on non-atomic shared data is undefined behaviour.
- **Common mistake:** Locking two mutexes in opposite orders in different threads → deadlock.

Practice: open `examples/05_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 6. seq_cst default

### Plain English

Threads run code concurrently. Shared mutable data needs a mutex (or atomics). Prefer RAII locks (`lock_guard`) so unlock happens even on exceptions.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::mutex m;
int counter = 0;
{
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);
  ++counter;
}
```

- **Remember:** A data race on non-atomic shared data is undefined behaviour.
- **Common mistake:** Locking two mutexes in opposite orders in different threads → deadlock.

Practice: open `examples/06_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 7. atomic flags

### Plain English

Threads run code concurrently. Shared mutable data needs a mutex (or atomics). Prefer RAII locks (`lock_guard`) so unlock happens even on exceptions.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::mutex m;
int counter = 0;
{
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);
  ++counter;
}
```

- **Remember:** A data race on non-atomic shared data is undefined behaviour.
- **Common mistake:** Locking two mutexes in opposite orders in different threads → deadlock.

Practice: open `examples/07_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 8. When atomics beat mutex

### Plain English

Threads run code concurrently. Shared mutable data needs a mutex (or atomics). Prefer RAII locks (`lock_guard`) so unlock happens even on exceptions.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::mutex m;
int counter = 0;
{
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);
  ++counter;
}
```

- **Remember:** A data race on non-atomic shared data is undefined behaviour.
- **Common mistake:** Locking two mutexes in opposite orders in different threads → deadlock.

Practice: open `examples/08_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 9. ABA problem intro

### Plain English

Threads run code concurrently. Shared mutable data needs a mutex (or atomics). Prefer RAII locks (`lock_guard`) so unlock happens even on exceptions.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::mutex m;
int counter = 0;
{
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);
  ++counter;

- **Common mistake:** Locking two mutexes in opposite orders in different threads → deadlock.

Practice: open `examples/09_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 10. Atomic counter

### Plain English

Threads run code concurrently. Shared mutable data needs a mutex (or atomics). Prefer RAII locks (`lock_guard`) so unlock happens even on exceptions.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::mutex m;
int counter = 0;
{
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> g(m);
  ++counter;
}

- **Common mistake:** Locking two mutexes in opposite orders in different threads → deadlock.

Practice: open `examples/10_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## What you should be able to do after Day 85

- Explain `atomics basics` to a peer without looking at notes.
- Compile and run all 10 examples with `-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra` (use newer flags only when the day needs C++20+).
- Answer the 5 questions in `questions.md` before peeking at `answers.md`.
- Write one tiny extra program that combines at least 3 of today's concepts.

Or open this day in the **Badsha hub** (`python3 hub/server.py`) and use Learn / Practice / Quiz tabs.
