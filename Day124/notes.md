# Day 124 -- bit utilities (C++20)

Today's goal: understand **bit utilities (C++20)** in plain English, see a tiny code sample for each idea, then practice in `examples/`.

How to study this day:
1. Read each concept's **Plain English** section.
2. Skim the code sample -- predict what it does.
3. Run the matching file under `examples/`.
4. Only then try `questions.md`.

## 1. bit_cast

### Plain English

Bit tricks set, clear, and test individual flags inside an integer. Prefer unsigned types for shift-heavy code. `std::bitset` makes fixed-width bit sets readable.

### Tiny code

```cpp
unsigned flags = 0;
flags |= (1u << 3);           // set bit 3
bool on = flags & (1u << 3);  // test
flags &= ~(1u << 3);          // clear
```

- **Remember:** Shifting into or past the sign bit on signed ints can be UB.
- **Common mistake:** Using signed `int` for bitmasks and shifting into the sign bit.

Practice: open `examples/01_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 2. endian

### Plain English

Iterators are like advanced pointers into a container. Algorithms take `[begin, end)` half-open ranges. Know when inserts/erases invalidate them.

### Tiny code

```cpp
std::vector<int> v{1,2,3};
for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it)
  std::cout << *it << ' ';
```

- **Remember:** After erase, use the iterator that `erase` returns.
- **Common mistake:** Incrementing an invalidated iterator → undefined behaviour.

Practice: open `examples/02_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 3. popcount / countl_zero

### Plain English

Bit tricks set, clear, and test individual flags inside an integer. Prefer unsigned types for shift-heavy code. `std::bitset` makes fixed-width bit sets readable.

### Tiny code

```cpp
unsigned flags = 0;
flags |= (1u << 3);           // set bit 3
bool on = flags & (1u << 3);  // test
flags &= ~(1u << 3);          // clear
```

- **Remember:** Shifting into or past the sign bit on signed ints can be UB.
- **Common mistake:** Using signed `int` for bitmasks and shifting into the sign bit.

Practice: open `examples/03_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 4. rotl / rotr

### Plain English

Bit tricks set, clear, and test individual flags inside an integer. Prefer unsigned types for shift-heavy code. `std::bitset` makes fixed-width bit sets readable.

```cpp
unsigned flags = 0;
flags |= (1u << 3);           // set bit 3
bool on = flags & (1u << 3);  // test
flags &= ~(1u << 3);          // clear
```

- **Remember:** Shifting into or past the sign bit on signed ints can be UB.
- **Common mistake:** Using signed `int` for bitmasks and shifting into the sign bit.

Practice: open `examples/04_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 5. has_single_bit

### Plain English

Bit tricks set, clear, and test individual flags inside an integer. Prefer unsigned types for shift-heavy code. `std::bitset` makes fixed-width bit sets readable.

### Tiny code

```cpp
unsigned flags = 0;
flags |= (1u << 3);           // set bit 3
bool on = flags & (1u << 3);  // test
flags &= ~(1u << 3);          // clear
```

- **Remember:** Shifting into or past the sign bit on signed ints can be UB.
- **Common mistake:** Using signed `int` for bitmasks and shifting into the sign bit.

Practice: open `examples/05_*.cpp`, predict the output, change one line, re-predict.

## 6. bit_floor / bit_ceil

### Plain English

### Tiny code

```cpp
unsigned flags = 0;
flags |= (1u << 3);           // set bit 3
bool on = flags & (1u << 3);  // test
flags &= ~(1u << 3);          // clear
```

## 7. Safe reinterpret

## What you should be able to do after Day 124

- Explain `bit utilities (C++20)` to a peer without looking at notes.
- Compile and run all 10 examples with `-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra` (use newer flags only when the day needs C++20+).
- Answer the 5 questions in `questions.md` before peeking at `answers.md`.
- Write one tiny extra program that combines at least 3 of today's concepts.

Or open this day in the **Badsha hub** (`python3 hub/server.py`) and use Learn / Practice / Quiz tabs.
